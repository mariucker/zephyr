  speed:
    type: int
    default: 20
    description: Define the number of Words Per Minute (wps) should be send
      per minute. This is defined using the standard word "PARIS". In the
      default case means that "20 wpm" send the word "PARIS" (or precisely
      "PARIS ") is sent 20 times in a minute.

      In morse the "PARIS " is 50 units long and represented by
      ".--. .- .-. .. .../" were

        10 dits (.)              10 units
        4 dahs (-)               12 units
        9 intra-character spaces  9 units
        4 inter-character spaces 12 units
        1 word space (/)          7 units

      In this case, the driver defines the time unit as 60/(50 * Speed). With a
      default speed of 20 wps the time unit is equal to 0.06s.
